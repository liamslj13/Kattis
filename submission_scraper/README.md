# KattisScraper

A Python script for logging into Kattis, fetching accepted submission IDs, and downloading the corresponding source code solutions to a local directory.

## Overview

This script logs into the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) online judge system using your credentials. It retrieves your accepted submissions and downloads the solution code for each problem into a folder called `solutions`. The script uses the [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/) library for HTTP requests and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for parsing HTML.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> This script is generated by an automated process (using Claude 3.7 Sonnet with some prompt engineering) and might have issues or run slowly. It may require adjustments if Kattis changes its page structure or login process. You learn more about known issues at the bottom of this page.

## Features

- **User Login:**  
  Authenticates using your Kattis username and password.
  
- **Submission Fetching:**  
  Scrapes your submissions to identify and collect accepted solutions.
  
- **Solution Download:**  
  Downloads source code for each accepted submission and saves them to the `solutions` directory.
  
- **File Extension Determination:**  
  Automatically detects the programming language from the source code to name files with the appropriate extension.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Required Libraries:**  
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`

Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```
## Known Issues
- The script is slow and re-downloads all solutions every time (no caching).
- File extension detection is unreliable (~25% failure rate); defaults to .txt if uncertain.
- Running the script may cause "Unsupported protocol" errors in your browser, preventing access to some sites; clearing cookies or site data usually resolves the issue.

## To Conclude
I am not very good with web scraping and will try to fix these issues when I have a bit more freetime. If you would like to make this script more efficient, or you know how to fix any bugs present within the script, feel free to create a pull request.
